# Software Project Management Skill

Structure software projects run by a single human operator using LLMs or subagents.

This Codex skill helps turn vague "just build it" work into a controlled delivery system with clear scope, small executable tasks, durable files, acceptance criteria, dependency sequencing, tests or evals, and guardrails. It is designed for people shipping real software with AI help, not for teams looking to recreate heavyweight enterprise PM inside a prompt.

## What You Can Achieve With This Skill

Use this skill to help Codex:

- rescue a drifting project that has become hard to resume or review
- turn a rough idea into a file-backed execution system
- break large work into small reviewable tasks with stable task IDs
- make progress survive context resets, model changes, and interrupted sessions
- add tests, evals, risks, and change control without over-managing the project
- handle real-world constraints like deadlines, approvals, vendor dependencies, quotas, and release risk only when they actually exist
- run solo-operator delivery with multiple models or subagents without losing control

Typical outcomes include:

- a concise project brief with scope, assumptions, and success criteria
- an ordered task queue with stable task IDs
- clear "done when" checks for each task
- a current-state note that makes handoffs and resumption easy
- a dependency sequence instead of vague urgency
- release or rollback notes when software is actually going to ship

## Who This Is For

This skill is for:

- solo founders and indie hackers using Codex as a serious delivery tool
- engineers steering multiple model runs or subagents
- operators rescuing messy AI-assisted software projects
- people who want the lightest effective process, but still need reliability

It is especially useful when the bottleneck is no longer coding speed, but coordination, continuity, verification, and operator attention.

## Core Idea

Most AI-assisted software projects do not fail because the model cannot write code. They fail because the work has weak scope, oversized tasks, missing acceptance criteria, hidden dependencies, stale docs, or no durable memory outside chat.

This skill gives Codex a practical control model:

1. Inspect the workspace before inventing process.
2. Extract the real objective, constraints, and success bar.
3. Build the smallest artifact set that preserves continuity.
4. Execute through small bounded tasks, not milestone-sized blobs.
5. Add stronger controls only when the project has a real reason for them.

The default stance is simple:

- use the lightest control system that still keeps the project resumable, reviewable, and safe
- keep durable state in files, not only in conversation history
- prefer task queues over milestone-only plans
- make assumptions explicit
- use dates, budgets, approvals, and release controls only when they are real constraints

## How The Skill Works

This repository follows Codex's progressive disclosure model:

### 1. Metadata triggers the skill

The `name` and `description` in [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md) tell Codex when this skill should be used.

### 2. `SKILL.md` provides the operating workflow

The main skill file gives Codex:

- the control philosophy
- the quick-start workflow
- the core artifact set
- task sizing and sequencing rules
- output standards
- guidance on when to load deeper references

The UI metadata in [`agents/openai.yaml`](./agents/openai.yaml) provides the human-facing display name, short description, and default prompt shown by Codex.

### 3. Reference files add depth only when needed

The bundled references let Codex stay lean by default and pull in detail only when the task requires it:

- [`references/project-rulebook.md`](./references/project-rulebook.md): the full rule system and coverage map
- [`references/external-constraints.md`](./references/external-constraints.md): deadlines, approvals, quotas, vendor dependencies, release safety
- [`references/ai-agent-practices.md`](./references/ai-agent-practices.md): file-backed memory, handoffs, evals, model routing, subagents, guardrails
- [`references/source-anchors.md`](./references/source-anchors.md): provenance and source tracking for the rule set

This gives you a full operating system for software delivery without forcing Codex to load the whole thing for every request.

## What Makes This Skill Different

Many project-management prompts either:

- stay too vague to survive real execution, or
- import too much ceremony for solo operator work

This skill is built around a different balance:

- strong enough for real delivery
- small enough for everyday use
- explicit enough for cross-model handoffs
- flexible enough to stay out of the way when the project is simple

It treats software project management as a control system for AI-assisted execution, not as a pile of rituals.

## Installation

Clone or copy this repository into your Codex skills directory so the folder name becomes:

```text
$CODEX_HOME/skills/software-project-management
```

For many local setups, that maps to:

```text
~/.codex/skills/software-project-management
```

Once installed, Codex can trigger the skill automatically when the request matches the skill description, or you can invoke it explicitly:

```text
Use $software-project-management to structure this project.
```

## Example Prompts

- `Use $software-project-management to rescue this drifting MVP project and rebuild the task queue.`
- `Use $software-project-management to turn this repo into a resumable solo-operator execution system.`
- `Use $software-project-management to break this feature roadmap into stable task IDs with acceptance checks.`
- `Use $software-project-management to prepare a safe release plan with rollback notes and monitoring checks.`
- `Use $software-project-management to set up multi-agent delivery rules, evals, and guardrails for this codebase.`

## Design Principles

- Default to solo-operator control, not team ceremony.
- Prefer reviewable tasks over heroic long runs.
- Keep project truth in files.
- Separate stable delivery practices from volatile vendor advice.
- Add complexity only when an actual constraint justifies it.

## Sources And Trust Model

The skill combines stable software-delivery guidance with recent AI-agent operating practice. The source log intentionally separates long-lived control rules from more volatile model and vendor patterns, so the skill can stay useful even as tooling changes.

That means the skill is opinionated, but not trendy for its own sake. It tries to preserve what actually helps a solo operator keep control while using modern coding agents.
