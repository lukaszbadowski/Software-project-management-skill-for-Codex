## Purpose and How to Use This Document
- Use this file as a rulebook for projects steered by one operator and executed partly or mostly through models or subagents.
- Default to the lightest control system that still preserves continuity: scope, small executable tasks, acceptance, dependency sequencing, durable files, tests or evals, change control, and permissions.
- Add dates, budgets, approval paths, vendor calendars, or release-window logic only when those external constraints are real. [S04] [S05] [S08]
- Treat the rules as a control system, not as ceremony. The goal is reliable value delivery under actual constraints. [S01] [S04] [S13]

## Universal Rules

### R01 - Define the value outcome before choosing process
- Applies to: solo operator, feedback-heavy, external-constraint, release-safety, agentic
- Required artifacts: problem statement, user or business outcome, success criteria
- Why it matters: process choice only makes sense after the operator knows what outcome the project must produce.
- Failure prevented: optimizing workflow while missing the real goal
- Source anchors: [S01] [S04] [S13]

### R02 - Keep one explicit operator decision record
- Applies to: solo operator, feedback-heavy, external-constraint, release-safety, agentic
- Required artifacts: operator decision record, open-decisions list
- Why it matters: solo projects still fail when decisions stay implicit or scattered.
- Failure prevented: thrash, contradictory choices across sessions, hidden assumptions
- Source anchors: [S04] [S17] [S18]

### R03 - Keep one visible system of record for project truth
- Applies to: solo operator, feedback-heavy, external-constraint, release-safety, agentic
- Required artifacts: source-of-truth index, linked working artifacts
- Why it matters: project state must survive context resets, model changes, and interruptions.
- Failure prevented: rediscovery, stale assumptions, fragmented context
- Source anchors: [S17] [S18] [S23]

### R04 - Make each meaningful work item bounded, testable, and resumable
- Applies to: solo operator, feedback-heavy, external-constraint, release-safety, agentic
- Required artifacts: decomposed work item, acceptance criteria, explicit stop point, resume-ready note
- Why it matters: if a task cannot be checked or resumed, it is not ready for reliable agentic execution.
- Failure prevented: vague tasks, repeated restarts, unverifiable progress
- Source anchors: [S07] [S09] [S17]

### R04A - Use milestones only as grouping; execute through small tasks
- Applies to: solo operator, feedback-heavy, external-constraint, release-safety, agentic
- Required artifacts: milestone or checkpoint map when useful, ordered task queue, task sizing rule
- Why it matters: milestones help orientation but they are too coarse to be safe default execution units for Codex.
- Failure prevented: long opaque runs, oversized diffs, weak operator visibility, and poor recovery after interruption
- Source anchors: [S07] [S17] [S18] [S23]

### R04B - Give every execution task a stable identifier
- Applies to: solo operator, feedback-heavy, external-constraint, release-safety, agentic
- Required artifacts: ordered task queue with stable task IDs, superseded or split-task history where relevant
- Why it matters: task titles change as understanding improves, but the operator still needs a stable handle for progress, review, and handoff.
- Failure prevented: losing track of what was worked on, ambiguous status updates, and broken continuity after task renames
- Source anchors: [S17] [S18] [S23]

## Project Prerequisites and Readiness Checks

### R05 - Do not start without a success definition and authority to proceed
- Applies to: solo operator, feedback-heavy, external-constraint, release-safety, agentic
- Required artifacts: mandate or explicit go signal, success criteria, stop conditions
- Why it matters: even a solo project needs a clear basis for starting and stopping.
- Failure prevented: shadow work, endless setup, vague "just explore" execution
- Source anchors: [S04] [S05]

### R06 - Surface hidden constraints early
- Applies to: solo operator, feedback-heavy, external-constraint, release-safety, agentic
- Required artifacts: constraint log covering NFRs, architecture, environments, permissions, release exposure, data readiness, quotas, compliance, and vendor dependencies where relevant
- Why it matters: most software slips come from forgotten constraints, not from typing speed.
- Failure prevented: late surprises in performance, security, data, release, or integration
- Source anchors: [S04] [S10] [S12]

### R07 - Prepare environments, data, and access as first-class work
- Applies to: solo operator, feedback-heavy, external-constraint, release-safety, agentic
- Required artifacts: environment plan, access checklist, test-data plan
- Why it matters: execution stalls when access and setup are treated as background chores.
- Failure prevented: blocked runs, fake progress, invalid testing
- Source anchors: [S04] [S12] [S18]

### R08 - Identify the real bottlenecks before planning around them
- Applies to: solo operator, feedback-heavy, external-constraint, release-safety, agentic
- Required artifacts: bottleneck map, capacity or quota note where relevant
- Why it matters: in solo operator projects the constraint is often operator attention, CI, model quota, environment access, or a single external dependency.
- Failure prevented: plans that look reasonable but ignore the actual limiter
- Source anchors: [S04] [S13] [S14] [S18]

## Lifecycle Selection and Tailoring Rules

### R09 - Default to the solo-operator control mode
- Applies to: solo operator, agentic
- Required artifacts: objective, work breakdown, small task queue with stable IDs, acceptance criteria, dependency sequence, durable current-state note
- Why it matters: most LLM-run work does not need extra ceremony.

- Source anchors: [S01] [S04] [S17]

### R10 - Add external-constraint controls only when fixed commitments are real
- Applies to: external-constraint, release-safety
- Required artifacts: constraint log, gate list, minimal critical-path or date-risk view, fallback assumptions
- Why it matters: dates, approvals, launch windows, and vendor commitments require tighter control, but only when they truly exist.
- Failure prevented: either under-controlling a real deadline or over-controlling a normal project
- Source anchors: [S05] [S08]

### R11 - Add feedback-heavy loops when learning dominates
- Applies to: feedback-heavy, solo operator
- Required artifacts: prioritized backlog, research questions, review trigger, scope-refresh trigger
- Why it matters: discovery work benefits from deliberate inspection and adaptation.
- Failure prevented: locking detail too early and learning too slowly

### R12 - Add release-safety controls when real software will be shipped
- Applies to: release-safety, external-constraint
- Required artifacts: release checklist, rollback note, monitoring checks, operator run notes

## Operator Control Model

### R13 - Keep decisions explicit and local to the operator
- Applies to: solo operator, feedback-heavy, external-constraint, release-safety, agentic

### R14 - Govern through evidence and triggers, not rituals
- Applies to: solo operator, feedback-heavy, external-constraint, release-safety, agentic

### R15 - Add outside approvals only when they are unavoidable
- Applies to: external-constraint, release-safety
- Required artifacts: approval checklist, required evidence, lead-time assumption
- Why it matters: approvals are a constraint branch, not a default operating model.
- Failure prevented: unnecessary waiting paths or missing real approvals
- Source anchors: [S04] [S05] [S10]

## Scope, Requirements, and Acceptance Criteria

### R16 - Separate outcome scope from solution scope
- Applies to: solo operator, feedback-heavy, external-constraint, release-safety, agentic
- Required artifacts: outcome statement, in-scope items, out-of-scope items, assumptions

### R18 - Attach acceptance and quality conditions to every substantial scope item
- Applies to: solo operator, feedback-heavy, external-constraint, release-safety, agentic
- Required artifacts: acceptance criteria, NFRs where relevant, definition of done or equivalent
- Why it matters: agents need explicit checks, not implied intent.
- Failure prevented: plausible but wrong outputs and rework after "done"
- Source anchors: [S03] [S04] [S09] [S16]

### R21 - Calculate a critical path only when timing or gates actually matter
- Applies to: external-constraint, release-safety
- Required artifacts: sequence model, gating assumptions, review trigger for the critical path
- Why it matters: most solo LLM-run projects do not need date math, but externally timed work does.
- Failure prevented: missing the true sequence drivers on a real deadline
- Source anchors: [S05] [S08]

### R22 - Estimate with explicit assumptions and confidence, not single-number certainty
- Applies to: solo operator, feedback-heavy, external-constraint, release-safety, agentic

### R27 - Treat transitions as deliverables when tools, models, or release stages change
- Applies to: solo operator, external-constraint, release-safety, agentic
- Required artifacts: transition checklist, changed assumptions, next-step note
- Why it matters: integration and transition work is real work.
