# Software Project Rules

This is the audit and rescue reference bundled with the `software-project-management` skill. `SKILL.md` is the operating spec; read this file when diagnosing a drifting project, auditing an existing control system, or deciding whether a control is worth adding. It is written for software projects run by a single human operator using LLMs or subagents. Source anchors refer to [source-anchors.md](./source-anchors.md).

Conventions:

- Rules apply to all control modes (solo operator, feedback-heavy, external-constraint, release-safety, agentic) unless an `Applies to` line narrows them.
- `Requires` names the artifact that proves the rule is being followed. Default artifacts live as sections in the canonical `pm/` files defined in [file-templates.md](./file-templates.md).
- `Prevents` names the failure the rule exists to stop.

- Sources: [S04] [S09]

## Planning: Backlog, Estimates, Dependencies, Critical Path, Resources, Budget

### R19 - Plan at three levels: overall direction, optional checkpoints, near-term executable tasks

- Prevents: detail paralysis or vague optimism
- Sources: [S05] [S06] [S12]

- Sources: [S03] [S05] [S12]

### R29 - Keep separate logs for risks, issues, and changes
- Requires: risk, issue, and change sections in `pm/DECISIONS.md`
- Prevents: confused control; threats, active problems, and scope changes need different responses

- Prevents: silent scope creep
- Sources: [S05] [S06]

## Quality Engineering and Test Strategy

### R33 - Design quality in before building, then verify continuously
- Requires: quality criteria, review strategy, test strategy
- Prevents: late defect discovery; quality cannot be added after the system is already wrong
- Sources: [S03] [S04]

### R34 - Use layered testing that matches software risk
- Requires: test layers, environment matrix, test-data plan
- Prevents: gaps caused by overreliance on one test type
- Sources: [S04] [S11] [S21]

### R34A - Define the verification ladder and evidence pack before implementation
- Requires: verification ladder, exact commands or checks, evidence capture plan
- Prevents: false-positive completion and "works for me" claims; an agent that cannot prove a change works will guess

- Prevents: feature output with weak user value; building the right product differs from building the product right
- Sources: [S01] [S02] [S11] [S13]

### R39 - Feed research and review findings back into scope and process
- Requires: backlog or scope updates, changed assumptions, improvement actions

- Prevents: repeated mistakes and abandoned loose ends
- Sources: [S02] [S05] [S14]

## AI-Agent Operating Rules

### R44 - Store durable task state in files, not only in chat
- Requires: the `pm/` files: plan, task queue with stable IDs, state note, decision log
- Prevents: context-window dependence and task amnesia; chat context is transient, files survive sessions and model changes
- Sources: [S17] [S18] [S23]

### R45 - Keep agent entry-point instructions short, stable, and navigational
- Requires: short `AGENTS.md` root instructions, linked deeper references
- Prevents: bloated instruction files that crowd out the task and reduce adherence
- Sources: [S15] [S18] [S23]

### R46 - Make the codebase legible before expecting autonomy
- Requires: architecture map, runnable commands, boundary rules, searchable references
- Prevents: hallucinated structure and repeated rediscovery; what the agent cannot discover effectively does not exist
- Sources: [S17] [S18]

### R47 - Make every autonomous task acceptance-driven and short enough to inspect
- Requires: task ID, acceptance criteria, exact commands, success condition, explicit stop condition, escalation rule
- Prevents: plausible-looking but unverifiable work and long opaque runs

### R47A - Use a fresh-context review pass for risky or cross-cutting changes
- Requires: review checklist or prompt, review findings, resolution note
- Prevents: missed edge cases, security issues, and regressions; the context that wrote a change is biased toward its own plan
- Sources: [S29] [S30] [S32]

### R48 - Route work to the smallest model tier that can do it reliably
- Requires: `Route:` tier per task (light, standard, heavy), tier-to-model-and-effort mapping in the active skill, escalation rule after two failures or low confidence, reviewer tier at least writer tier
- Prevents: paying heavy-model prices for mechanical work, and light models silently owning risky decisions
- Sources: [S15] [S19] [S20]

### R49 - Prefer subagents for autonomy-ready bounded work that protects main context
- Requires: scoped subtask brief, expected output, verification command, expected evidence, tool limits
- Prevents: context pollution and main-thread drift into low-signal execution detail
- Sources: [S25] [S30]

### R50 - Enforce least privilege and explicit operator approval paths
- Requires: permission mode, hook rules, destructive-action policy, escalation rules
- Prevents: accidental destructive behavior and overbroad access
- Sources: [S24]

### R51 - Convert repeated failures into documentation, tooling, or policy improvements
- Requires: failure log, updated docs or tools, validation of the improvement
- Prevents: paying the same coordination tax every run
- Sources: [S13] [S14] [S18]

### R52 - Treat evals as required infrastructure for prompt, model, and workflow changes
- Requires: eval set, regression checks, change note
- Prevents: silent degradation masked by anecdotal wins
- Sources: [S16]

### R53 - Prefer mechanical invariants over taste-by-conversation
- Requires: structural checks, lint rules, boundary tests, repo conventions
- Prevents: style drift, boundary erosion, inconsistent outputs
- Sources: [S18]

### R53A - Encode zero-exception quality checks in deterministic guardrails when possible
- Requires: hook or validator configuration, blocking rules, scope note
- Prevents: skipped validation and policy drift under pressure; advice drifts, deterministic enforcement does not
- Sources: [S28] [S32] [S33]

### R54 - Use vendor-neutral handoff artifacts for cross-model interoperability
- Requires: task brief, current task ID, current-state summary, exact file list, commands run, expected next action
- Prevents: hidden-context handoffs and model-specific dead ends
- Sources: [S17] [S18] [S23]

### R55 - Define trust boundaries for agent inputs, secrets, and side effects
- Requires: trust-boundary policy, secret-handling rules, external-input policy, signoff rules for privileged actions
- Prevents: prompt-injection-driven actions, secret exposure, unsafe automation
- Sources: [S18] [S24]

## Recent Vendor and Benchmark Shifts

### R56 - Assume benchmark claims are provisional until reproduced on your own tasks
- Requires: local eval suite, benchmark interpretation note
- Prevents: overtrusting leaderboard wins that do not transfer
- Sources: [S21] [S22]

### R57 - Assume models, costs, and capabilities will drift; revalidate routing and prompts when conditions change
- Requires: revalidation trigger, routing refresh, prompt or eval refresh
- Prevents: stale optimization choices and degraded reliability
- Sources: [S19] [S20]

### R58 - Treat operator attention as a scarce resource and design around it
- Requires: attention bottleneck note, automation strategy, review trigger
- Prevents: hidden review bottlenecks; the real critical path is often what the operator must inspect manually
- Sources: [S13] [S14] [S18]

### R58A - Pilot large automated changes on a narrow slice before scaling out
- Requires: pilot slice, scale-out trigger, stop trigger, refinement note
- Prevents: repo-wide low-quality churn and hard-to-undo mass edits
- Sources: [S26] [S29] [S32]

| Agentic | LLM agents or subagents perform substantial execution | `AGENTS.md` entry-point rules, task-state files, model routing, evals, trust boundaries |

The former Appendix C (question coverage map from the original research pack) moved to the research workspace; it documented research completeness, not runtime behavior.
