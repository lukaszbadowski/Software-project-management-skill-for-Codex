# Software Project Management

## Overview

Use this skill to turn vague AI-assisted delivery work into a controlled execution system for one human operator. Default to objective, scope, small executable tasks, acceptance, dependency sequencing, durable files, tests or evals, risk or change logs, and permissions. Add deadline, approval, vendor, budget, or release-window controls only when the project actually has those external constraints.

## Quick Start

1. Inspect the workspace for existing project artifacts before inventing new ones.
2. Classify the work as `solo operator default` or `external-constraint branch`.
3. Create or repair the minimum control system: operator objective, scope, small executable tasks, acceptance, work plan, dependency sequence, risk or change controls, documentation, and guardrails.
4. Produce the lightest artifact set that preserves continuity across sessions, models, and agent runs.

## Workflow

### Build Context First

- Extract the real objective, users, constraints, dependency landscape, acceptance bar, and release expectations. Only treat deadlines, budgets, approvals, vendor schedules, or launch windows as first-class inputs if they are explicit in the project context.
- Look for an existing task brief, execution plan, backlog, design docs, ADRs, test strategy, release plan, runbooks, risk log, and agent rule files.
- If important information is missing, make reasonable assumptions and record them explicitly.
- If the request is to rescue a project, diagnose the control system before proposing fixes: objective clarity, scope quality, dependency visibility, acceptance quality, risk hygiene, context legibility, tool permissions, and release readiness where relevant.

### Choose the Control Mode

- Default to the `solo operator` control mode when one operator is steering LLMs or subagents through the work.
- Add the `external-constraint` branch when a fixed deadline, compliance gate, approval step, vendor dependency, quota cap, or launch window is real.
- Add the `feedback-heavy` branch when user learning, UX iteration, or discovery dominates the work.
- Add the `release-safety` branch when the project ships software that needs cutover, rollback, monitoring, or operating notes.

### Create or Repair the Core Artifact Set

Always maintain these artifacts in some form:
- objective and success criteria
- operator decision record
- source-of-truth index
- scoped work breakdown or backlog
- small task queue for the next executable units
- acceptance and quality criteria
- dependency map or dependency sequence
- durable execution plan or current-state note
- risk, issue, and change controls
- permission and trust-boundary rules
- documentation freshness path

Add these artifacts when needed:
- External constraints: deadline or gate log, minimal critical-path view, vendor or approval dependency list, quota or spend tracker
- Feedback-heavy: research questions, findings log, scope-update loop
- Agent-assisted: agent instruction entry point, model or task routing, evals, and explicit escalation rules
- Release safety: release checklist, rollback plan, monitoring checks, operating notes or runbook

### Size the Execution Units

- Use milestones, themes, or phases only to group work. Do not use them as the next action.
- Default to a task queue where each task is small enough for one focused agent run and one quick operator review.
- Make each task narrow in scope: one subsystem, interface, document, or test surface when possible.
- Give every task an explicit stop point, file or module scope, dependency or precondition, and acceptance check.
- If a task would touch many unrelated areas or require a long uninterrupted run, split it before execution.
- After each completed task, update the current-state note, record evidence, and choose the next task.

### Plan and Govern the Work

- Plan at three levels: overall direction, optional checkpoints, and near-term executable tasks. Only add long-range date plans when external commitments require them.
- Map dependencies explicitly, including environments, data, approvals, vendors, quotas, and external systems when they matter.
- Calculate and monitor a critical path only when an external deadline, approval gate, launch window, or scarce bottleneck makes it useful.
- Plan scarce resources only when they constrain throughput: operator attention, CI capacity, API quotas, model budget, environment access, or permissions.
- Treat scope change as a trade-off decision, not as a free addition.
- Govern by evidence and explicit triggers. Do not introduce recurring rituals unless they improve control for this specific project.

### Control Quality, Value, and Learning

- Separate user testing for product quality from user research for product value.
- Treat non-functional requirements as release criteria, not deferred polish.
- Keep documentation living: versioned, owned, refreshed, and retired when stale.
- Turn repeated failures into process, tooling, documentation, or policy improvements.

### Extend the System for Agent-Assisted Delivery

- Keep durable task state in files, not only in chat.
- Keep entry-point instructions short and navigational.
- Use vendor-neutral handoff artifacts so different models can continue work safely.
- Use subagents only for bounded parallel work or high-volume output.
- Enforce least privilege, secret-handling rules, trust boundaries, and explicit operator approval for risky actions.
- Revalidate prompts, models, and workflows with evals when behavior or tooling changes.

## Common Deliverables

- operator project plan
- micro-task backlog or execution queue
- project rescue assessment
- artifact checklist tailored to lifecycle
- dependency and sequencing analysis
- risk, quality, and release-control plan
- agentic execution and guardrail plan
- external-constraint addendum, only when deadlines, approvals, vendors, or launch windows matter

## Reference Files

- Read [references/project-rulebook.md](./references/project-rulebook.md) for the full rule system and coverage map.
- Read [references/external-constraints.md](./references/external-constraints.md) only when the project has fixed deadlines, approval gates, vendor dependencies, quota caps, launch windows, or production release risk.
- Read [references/ai-agent-practices.md](./references/ai-agent-practices.md) when planning file-backed memory, model routing, subagents, evals, and guardrails.
- Read [references/source-anchors.md](./references/source-anchors.md) when you need provenance, volatile vendor anchors, or a refresh point for unstable topics.
- Do not load every reference by default. Read the smallest relevant file first.

## Output Standards

- Write in imperative form.
- Prefer concrete artifacts and decision-ready outputs over generic PM advice.
- Make assumptions explicit whenever the workspace does not contain enough project context.
- Distinguish stable control practices from volatile vendor recommendations.
- Prefer task queues over milestone-only plans.
- Default task format: `Task`, `Scope`, `Depends on`, `Done when`, and `Stop after`.
- When in doubt, split work into smaller tasks before execution.
- Do not introduce date plans, budget tracking, approval workflows, recurring cadences, or stage gates unless the project genuinely depends on them.
- If the user asks for the latest model, benchmark, or vendor workflow guidance, verify it externally before answering because the bundled source anchors are point-in-time snapshots.
